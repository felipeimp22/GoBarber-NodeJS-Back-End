# GoBarber-NodeJS-Back-End V 0.1
developing in the rocketseat bootcamp.

## What does it do ?
Make an api, connect in postgreSQL and set up with sequelize,
this creates the user and validates their information with rules and middlewares and generates a security token,
doing some routes:
 
 #### create(to create a new user)
 #### uptade(to change password and some information)
 #### ession(for user log in and generate some token validation).
 
 ### this code is under development yet. thanks, i hope u enjoy.
